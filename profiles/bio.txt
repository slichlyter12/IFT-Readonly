===== Where did this wiki come from? =====
In "An information foraging theory perspective on tools for debugging, refactoring, and reuse tasks", (TOSEM 22(2), 14) Fleming et al. demonstrated that IFT can be used to obtain insights into how and why software engineering tools can aid developers. The key contribution of this work was looking at successful tools through an IFT lens and generalizing specific tool designs to independent, generalizable and reusable IFT-based design patterns.

This project is a continuation of that work. Our goal is to collect and document IFT-based
Design patterns from software engineering tool builders. This design pattern catalog will serve as a valuable resource for tool builders to design better tools for software engineers.

To collect IFT-based design patterns from tool builders, we used a composite of civic participation and shepherding. At first, we created a community wiki containing training materials and invited software engineering researchers to document their own tool design insights tool design insights in the form of design patterns. We also helped our contributors to improve and finalize their design patterns by providing continuous feedback to their work. 

The finalized design pattern catalog from this community collection process is presented here.
